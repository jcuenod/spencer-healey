tagline: If I could go back 15 years and pay $1000/session for ADHD coaching, I would do it. I spent the first half of my life wasting time doing a thousand random things badly and never doing anything well. It was only after I had scrounged my way through a graduate degree that I found myself in an ADHD coaching office where my life completely changed.
