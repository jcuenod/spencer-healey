tagline: When I sit down to work, I immediately feel tired. I decide to make tea. I remember something interesting I wanted to read. I find myself watching a youtube video about investment or making a website for a friend. Focus is a limited resource. ADHD Coaching helped me to channel it and maximise my focus on the things that matter to me.
